# Gridfinity printer tool caddy

Any hobby brings with it a bundle of tools that you'll need -- either on hand for daily use, or in easily locatable storage for that twice-a-year use. What makes 3D printing unique is that you can create storage to fit your exact needs and space!

Gridfinity is one such option created by 3D printing guru Zack Freidman. At its essence, it's a tool display system based on a 42mm[^1] grid. Display rather than storage focused, so you can find your tools when you need them. And because it's an open and free standard, makers around the world have created countless options for storage using Gridfinity, and you can make your own as you get familiar with creating in CAD software.

What's provided here is a kit to print for your basic printer toolkit, but it's just one of an infinite number of possible configurations.

Parts in this repository and their sources:

* Weighted 3x4 baseplate [source](https://thangs.com/designer/ZackFreedman/3d-model/Gridfinity%20Baseplates-60925)
* Side cutter and tweezer holder [source](https://www.printables.com/model/354482-gridfinity-1x1-sidecutter-and-tweezer-holder)
* Ultralight divider bin [source](https://www.printables.com/model/640799-gridfinity-ultra-light-bins-divider-edition) Note: these are great because they print quickly, though that's partly because they skip a few "standard" Gridfinity features. I recommend seeing what might suit your needs from the full collection.

[^1]: Get used to using millimeters; Thomas Jefferson was a fan of metric, even though he wasn't known to use 3D printers. It's arguable that pirates caused the USA not to switch to metric around 1800, but that's [another story](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/28/574044232/how-pirates-of-the-caribbean-hijacked-americas-metric-system).
